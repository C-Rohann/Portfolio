# 🚍 IoT Based Live Tracking System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **IoT-based real-time tracking system** designed primarily for **child safety in school and college buses**.  
It uses an **ESP8266 Wi-Fi module** along with a **GPS NEO-6M module** to collect live location data.  
The system uploads **GPS coordinates to a web server**, where the location is displayed on a map interface that can be accessed by **parents and guardians**.

## ⚙️ Features
- 📡 **Real-time Location Tracking** using GPS NEO-6M.  
- 🌐 **ESP8266 Web Server** to transmit live coordinates.  
- 🗺️ **Interactive Map** to visualize student location in real time.  
- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Parental Access** to monitor children’s travel safety.  
- 🚌 Designed for **school and college buses**.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. GPS NEO-6M fetches latitude & longitude of the bus.  
2. ESP8266 reads data and uploads it to the server.  
3. Parents access the **web page with live GPS map** from any device.  
4. Ensures **safety & monitoring** of students during transit.
