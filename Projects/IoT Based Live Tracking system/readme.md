# 🚍 IoT Based Live Tracking System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **IoT-based real-time tracking system** designed primarily for **child safety in school and college buses**.  
It uses an **ESP8266 Wi-Fi module** along with a **GPS NEO-6M module** to collect live location data.  
The system uploads **GPS coordinates to a web server**, where the location is displayed on a map interface that can be accessed by **parents and guardians**.
