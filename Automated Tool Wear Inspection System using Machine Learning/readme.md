# 🛠️ Automated Tool Wear Inspection System using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents the development of an **Automated Tool Wear Inspection System** that uses **Machine Learning** to detect and classify tool wear conditions.  
The system aims to improve manufacturing efficiency by **predicting tool life, reducing downtime, and ensuring product quality**.  

We designed and built the **hardware structure using 3D modeling and 3D printing**, and integrated it with **computer vision, data analytics, and machine learning** for automated inspection.
